GMMenuList program creating during Tutorial Video Series

This system is the program we created during the video series I created to provide a intro to Java programming. 

There are definitely some errors and improvements that could be made to this version. 

Including: <p>did not ensure user enters integer when requiring integer intput
  <p>did not use Player's instance member "index" to only look at valid Actions during highest roll algorithm
